## EDA and Data Structuring with Python - Unicorns Data ##

This project involves data wrangling, exploratory analysis with the Pandas library, and data structuring methods.

It simulates a workplace scenario where a fictional team analyzes financial data on unicorn companies â€” those valued at over one billion dollars.

The project comprises four tasks across various research areas, drawing conclusions supported by visualizations, all using Python.

The work was conducted using Jupyter Notebooks and presented in PDF format.
